# In a async for...of loop, if the IteratorResult.value of the async iterator
# is a promise-like object, it will be awaited before actually being yielded.
# Currently, we simply insert an additional await expression. But this
# introduces additional tick which can be observed. The alternative would be
# to query the IteratorResult.value but that could also be observed.
# Example of test that require the additional await:
